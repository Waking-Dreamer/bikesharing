# NYC Citi Bike & Des Moines Analysis
The primary question we are looking at is whether or not it would be profitable to start a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We are looking at actual bike share data from Citi Bike activity in New York City during the month of August to help us make an assessment.

We are specifically looking at one selected question: “What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?”

### Tableau Story Walkthrough

The first few story points show general Citi Bike data from NYC during the month of August. This gives a general idea of what this data looks like, how much bike rental activity there was during the month, what the most active rental times of day were, and where were the most busy rental locations.

For the month of August in NYC, there was a total of 2,322,224 Citi Bike trips taken. 65% of these trips were completed by individuals who identify as male. According to census.gov, as of July 1, 2019, 49.2% of the population was male in Des Moines and 47.7% was male in NYC. Given that 65% of Citi Bike Customers, in NYC, identify as male, one could potentially hypothesize that there could be a slight increase in individuals using bike share services in Des Moines, because there is a higher precent of males in this city (1.5%), when compared to NYC, but the impact would be minimal.

The question of gender has a minor impact on the potential bike share business in Des Moines and there are far more important questions that we should be asking to determine the profitability of a bike share program in Des Moines. For example, lets look at population. According to nyc.gov, as of July 1, 2019, the population of NYC was 8,336,817. According to census.gov, as of July 1, 2019, the population of Des Moines was 214,237. Just off of the size of the city alone, we could conclude that any potential profit from a hypothetical bike share program in Des Moines, would be only 2.6% of what is earned from the Citi Bike program in NYC. Population has a far greater impact on this analysis when compared to gender.

Lets quickly look at another factor that has a much bigger potential impact on profit; tourism. NYC is a large international city that people visit from all over the world. According to nycfuture.org, 62.8 million people visited NYC in 2017. Des Moines is not a sought after travel destination and is such a small city, that no relevant tourist data could be found. Of the 2,344,224 total Citi bike trips, in NYC during the month of August, how many of them were completed by residents vs. tourists? One needs to take into account that there will be a far lesser percentage of tourists in Des Moines when compared to NYC and this is another factor that could reduce potential profit if a bike share operation were started in Des Moines.

If we are really looking at the profitability of opening a bike share program in Des Moines, Iowa, there are several factors we need to look into. Considering the current Coid-19 situation, in this country, is another one. When it comes to opening a bike share program in Des Moines there are several large factors that provide evidence that it would be a risky investment with a much smaller profitability when compared to the NYC Citi Bike data. Out of the numerous questions we can ask, looking at gender has a very minor impact on potential profit when compared to the other factors that we briefly addressed.
